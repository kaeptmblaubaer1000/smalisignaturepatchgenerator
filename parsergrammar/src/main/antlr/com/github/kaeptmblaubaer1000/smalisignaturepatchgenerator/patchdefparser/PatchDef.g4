// but I've removed \f from the escapes and added \$ since this DSL should be compatible with Kotlin and Groovy, because \f is missing
// in Kotlin and you don't need it in this DSL, and $ is reserved for templates in Groovy and Kotlin and has to be escaped.
// Because of this I've also forbidden a literal $.
